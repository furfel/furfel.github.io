Hi, I am Peter. This is a website for my paracompany Furfel.
As a high-school kid I used to fake that this company is large. Today,
I approach the subject in a manner of people who are known on the
web - I just write it lightly, without much formality.

~~I used to create games.~~ I am back to gamedev. Also, I try to create some
Raspberry Pi projects, writing my masters and learning things of the
future.

In 2019 I read 48 books - add me on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/piotrp94).

I also have a Twitter [@_furfel](https://twitter.com/_furfel).
And because I try to care about my image, I rarely post there (politics is too tempting).

My Githubs:
* [furfel](https://github.com/furfel) - better quality stuff here,
* [thefurfel](https://github.com/thefurfel) - archive of the above, from before user -> org conversion,
* [pfoof](https://github.com/pfoof) - some trash, some nonsense, some scraps.
