## Furfel Privacy Policy Policy
### For #Rekt 420 MLG Fast Jump

*Last update 04 May 2022*

This privacy policy will guide you what kind of data Furfel collects, for what reason and how it is
being used.

### 1. Data that is collected

We collect just in-game events that you as the user perform. These are screen taps, button clicks,
achievements unlocked and the time to reach each level in the game (for example achievement of score
360). The events also may contain basic device information: model, CPU, screen size.

### 2. Why is data collected and how is it used

Thanks to the collected data we are able to model current experience of the players and try to improve
the gameplay. We do not share your data with anyone else.
We use Firebase/Google Analytics suite to collect events. The data retention period is the shortest
possible which is 60 days. All the events are anonymous as much as the SDK lets us. We do not archive
the data beyond the 60 day period. We only keep aggregated numbers based on longer time periods and only
if there was enough events to create an average or median.

### 3. Ads

By default, the ads served by AdMob are **non-personalized**. It might change in the future but for the 
current moment there is no way to change this behavior.

### 4. Contact

If you want to contact us to get more information or request removal of the data, please write an e-mail
to hello@furfel.com including your tracking ID copied from the app. This ID can be found in the bottom
left menu with the Furfel logo. This is the same place where this Privacy Policy can be accessed
from within the app.

### 5. Age requirements

If you are under the age of 13, we kindly ask you to not use the app or contact your parent or guardian
before continuing. Even with their consent, the app is not directed to youth under 16 years old.
We cannot confirm that the individual using the app is of the appropriate age. However, in case they
are not meeting the requirement, we hold right to prevent their access to the app.

### 6. Changes

This privacy policy might change. In case of changes, we would inform the user and give you the
opportunity to get to know the new privacy policy before using the app.
