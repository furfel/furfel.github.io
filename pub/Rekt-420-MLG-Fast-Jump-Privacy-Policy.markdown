## Furfel Privacy Policy Policy
### For #Rekt 420 MLG Fast Jump

*Last update 12 December 2024*

This Privacy Policy explains what kind of data Furfel collects, why it is collected, and how it is used. By using this app, you agree to the terms outlined below.

### 1. Data Collection

We collect in-game events that you, as the user, perform. These include:

- Screen taps
- Button clicks
- Achievements unlocked
- Time taken to reach each level in the game (e.g., achieving a score of 360).

Additionally, the collected events may include basic device information such as model, CPU, and screen size.

### 2. Purpose of Data Collection

The data collected helps us understand player experiences and improve gameplay.

- **Data Sharing**: Your data is not shared with any third parties.
- **Tools Used**: We use Firebase/Google Analytics to collect events.
- **Data Retention**: Data is retained for the shortest period possible, which is 60 days. After this period, individual event data is deleted. Aggregated metrics, such as averages or medians, may be retained beyond this period, but only if there is sufficient data to generate meaningful insights.
- **Anonymization**: We ensure the data is as anonymous as the tools we use allow.

**Additionally**, if you consent to personalized advertising (described in section 3), our partners may use your interactions with ads, coarse location, IP, and past interactions to serve you personalized ads. You can opt out any time (see section 4).

### 3. Advertising

When you first launch the app, you will be presented with a consent form for ad preferences. You can choose between:

- **Personalized Advertising**: Ads tailored to your interests based on interactions with ads, apps, and websites you’ve visited.
- **Non-Personalized Advertising**: Generic ads that do not consider your browsing behavior.

You can change your ad preferences later within the app’s settings menu. Ads will not be displayed until you make a selection during the consent process.

### 4. Managing and Deleting Your Data

Access the menu via the Furfel logo (“F”) in the bottom-left corner, where you will find options to manage your data.

You have full control over your data:

- **Deleting Analytics Data**: You can delete your collected analytics data directly within the app.
- **Copying Your Tracking ID**: Use the same menu to copy your tracking ID, which is necessary for data-related requests if you contact us.
- **Changing ad consent settings**: You can change your ad consent settings at any time within this menu.
- **Requesting Assistance**: If you need additional help or want to ensure data removal, contact us at hello@furfel.com, providing your tracking ID for verification.

This menu also provides access to this Privacy Policy.

### 5. Age Requirements

This app is not intended for users under the age of 16.

- If you are under 13, please do not use the app. If you are between 13 and 16, you must have parental or guardian consent to use the app.
- We reserve the right to restrict access if a user does not meet these age requirements.

### 6. Policy Updates

This Privacy Policy may change over time. In case of updates:

- We will inform users about the changes.
- You will have the opportunity to review the new Privacy Policy before continuing to use the app.

### 7. Disagreement

If you do not agree with the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy, please:

- Use the home button to exit the app.
- Uninstall the app through your device’s settings.
